    <h1>Welcome to Troop 89's Transitional Website!</h1>
    <span class="meta"> Posted on October 7th 2018 by Brian Schubert.</span>

    <h2>Welcome scouts, parents, and members of the Medfield community! </h2>

    <p> Troop 89's website is currently being updated to provide a more rich platform for communicating with the
        Medfield community.</p>
    <p> Over the course of this upcoming year, our website will be evolving dramatically to include many long-desired
        features. For details on the current state of our website, please read further. If you have any questions or
        concerns regarding our website, please do not hesitate <a href="mailto:webmaster@troop89medfield.org"> to reach
            out to our webmaster</a>.</p>

    <h2> Youth Protection Training </h2>

    <p> Adults who assist with any Troop activities <b>need</b> to take the on-line BSA training for Youth Protection.</p>
    <p> This is required to be taken and needs to be updated annually. There are several adults whose Youth Protection
        training will expire before September 30th. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org">https://my.scouting.org</a>
        to take the training. It will take about an hour to complete the training. And, yes, thereâ€™s a test at the end.

    <h2> A Word on the State of this Website</h2>

    <p> The Troop 89 website is actively being designed and constructed by youth members of Troop 89. Every feature,
        from our public calendar to our internal mailing lists, was developed by a Troop 89 scout.
    <p> Currently, our website is running with only a small subset of the features that have been developed for it.
        Writing scalable applications is not an easy task, especially when they require extensive database interaction
        with minimal server resources. To ensure that no significant errors make their way to production, every feature
        being developed for our website first undergoes an lengthy period of internal testing on a separate server. This
        gradual development process has the unfortunate effect of hiding progress from the public eye for elongated
        periods of time.</p>
    <p> For the moment, our public facing website is intentionally left feature barren while the core components of our
        website are being developed in the background. While we have high hopes for making this website a powerful tool
        in the near future, it is likely these ambitions will not be realized until 2019. The fall is a busy time for
        our High School members, who are responsible for all the progress on ur website. As such, it is to be expected
        that our website will remain in a similar state for the next few months. Come early 2019, however, a significant
        amount of time will be dedicated to releasing the remaining features promised for our website.
    </p>

    <h2>To Scouts interested in Web Development</h2>

    <p>In the near future, the time will come when this website will be entrusted to the care of a new youth
        Webmaster.</p>
    <p> In the spring, our current Webmaster will be giving a series of presentations to our troop on how to
        contribute to our website. If you think that you will be interested in helping out with the design and
        maintenance of our website, it is highly recommended that you get a taste of web technologies before these
        talks.</p>
    <p> What follows is a terse summary of the technologies that our website is being built on, along with comments on
        the relative desirability of familiarity with each of them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For any non-trivial contribution, a strong understanding of web basics will be expected. A good goal would
            be being able to answer the question, "what happens when I request a web page?"
        </li>
        <li>For those seeking to contribute to our website's backend, familiarity with Python is a must. Our site is
            powered by the Django web framework and all of its core components are written in Python 3.6+.
        </li>
        <li>Linux administration skills are a huge plus. Our site is hosted on GNU/Linux server, so developing on linux
            is ideal.
        </li>
        <li> Some experience with database administration (preferably PostgreSQL) is a "nice to have." Most database
            interactions are abstracted behind an object relational mapper, but an understanding of what goes on
            "under the hood" can be instrumental when designing new relations.
        </li>
        <li>Knowledge of more domain-specific technologies, including SCSS and the Django template language, is
            optional, but would be helpful if one intends to build new features from scratch.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you already have some familiarity with a few of the above noted technologies and would like to get copy of
        our website's source and infrastructure documentation before the spring, you may reach out to our webmaster over
        email to begin making arrangements.</p>
