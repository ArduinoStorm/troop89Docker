Travis CI
^^^^^^^^^

The Troop 89 website uses `Travis CI`_ for `continuous integration`_. Documentation for Travis is `available online`_, though you will likley never need to worry about changing the configuration.

.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.com/blueschu/troop89medfield.org
.. _continuous integration: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/#what-is-continuous-integration-ci
.. _available online: https://docs.travis-ci.com/

All configuration for Travis CI is contained in the ``.travis.yml`` file.

Coveralls
^^^^^^^^^

The Troop 89 website uses `Coveralls.io`_ to display its code coverage data. Code coverage analysis is performed by the Python `coverage`_ package. If you have installed the development dependencies, you can generate a manual coverage report by running the following commands

.. code-block:: console

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage report

Documentation for ``coverage`` is available on `coverage Read the Docs`_.

.. _Coveralls.io: https://coveralls.io/github/blueschu/troop89medfield.org
.. _coverage: https://pypi.org/project/coverage/
.. _coverage Read the Docs: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/


Coverage data is submitted to `Coveralls.io`_ by a `Travis CI`_ job phase. This step is handled by the `coveralls-python`_ package. Note that the coveralls API key is stored by Travis CI in an environment variable.

.. _coveralls-python: https://github.com/coveralls-clients/coveralls-python

Uptime Robot
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Uptime Robot`_ periodically monitors the Troop 89 Website for server issues. Uptime statistics are available on the `Troop 89 Website Public Status page`_.
